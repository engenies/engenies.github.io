### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorites because we began to use the command line argument to read the program rather than a previous labâ€™s use of (Cin). In this lab, I liked how this was a simple mad lib of making a sandwich where only three arguments would allow the program to run. In this lab, I learned how to skip over an argument in index 0 and replace the blanks with the argument at index 1 provided by the user.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was another one of my favorites because although I did not initially know how blackjack worked, I learned how each card would affect the result and how to incorporate that into the program. This was a harder program to write because I still had not gotten the hang of how to use (bool) but with the help of others, I began to understand the use when something was false or true. When using (bool) was needed in other labs, I had more of an understanding.  

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite because this was one of the few labs which included an image as the outcome rather than just words on the screen. From this lab I learned how to build sine lookup tables used when creating the animation part. The part I enjoyed the most was seeing the outcome of the gif that flashed with many assorted colors.
